# Active Context: Curious Magpie Static Site

## Current State

**Site Status**: ✅ Static HTML/CSS site ready for GitHub Pages

The site has been converted from a Next.js app to a plain static HTML/CSS site. No build step required. Hosted directly on GitHub Pages.

## Recently Completed

- [x] **Design review & cleanup (2026-02-27)**:
  - Replaced agenda placeholder cards with simple "more dates coming" text
  - Accessibility: added skip-nav link, aria-expanded on hamburger, aria-hidden on decorative emoji
  - Moved all inline styles to CSS classes (hero-img-frame, about-section, contact-grid, product card rotations via nth-child, etc.)
  - CSS cleanup: removed 6 duplicate color alias variables, ~30 unused classes, unnecessary !important — reduced CSS by ~293 lines
  - Added `loading="lazy"` to all below-the-fold images
  - Updated products CTA to clarify purchase options (markets + email)

## Current Focus

Website is a static site for Curious Magpie ceramics atelier (Marjolein IJbema).

### To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push to `main` branch
2. Go to GitHub repo Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
3. Save — the site will be live within a minute

Pending user actions:
1. Replace SVG stub illustrations in `images/` with real product photos (swap SVG for JPG/PNG, update `src` in HTML)
2. Update email address in contact page (currently info@curiousmagpie.nl)
3. Update market dates in agenda page as needed
4. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`)

## Quick Start Guide

### To edit content:

Edit the HTML files directly. No build step needed.

### To preview locally:

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple HTTP server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### To add a new page:

1. Create a directory with an `index.html` file
2. Copy the header/footer from an existing page
3. Add navigation links to all pages
